# Home Assistant Prune

## Problem Statement

Devices can be renamed outside of Home Assistant. When this happens, the integration does not propagate that change to Home Assistant, i.e., the `entity_id` is not changed. This makes sense to not break automations etc.

On the other hand, that causes names outside and inside of Home Assistant to diverge over time. See this [feature request](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/reset-re-acquire-entity-id/723097) for concrete user stories.

Unfortunately, Home Assistant lacks a functionality to re-acquire the current names from the integrations.

## Solution Approach
1. Remove all entities from file `core.entity_registry` where `platform` matches.
2. Remove the same entities from file `core.restore_state`, if existing.
3. Remove the devices with matching `id` from file `core.device_registry`.


## Usage
First of all, stop Home Assistant. To my experience, the integration/platform does not need to be removed.

Backup your configuration directory. The script does not do backups.

### Prune Entities

Run, e.g.

```
ha-prune.py --path homeassistant-config prune --platform hue
```

Use `--dry-run` or `-n` to not actually write anything to disk.

Restart Home Assistant. The entities should be automatically re-discovered under their new name (i.e. the names obtained from the integration).

### Save and restore (friendly) names

The command:

```
ha-prune.py --path homeassistant-config save "out.json"
```

saves the friendly names, if set, for all entities. It produces a file like:

```
{
    "switch.horus": "Horus",
    "sensor.sentinel_1_air_temperature": "Flur",
    "device_tracker.thermostat_wohnzimmer": "Thermostat Wohnzimmer",
    "switch.janus_1": "Heizl√ºfter",
}
```

vice versa

```
ha-prune.py --path homeassistant-config restore out.json
```

restores the friendly names, if modified.

## Known Problems

### Unstable IDs
IDs like

```json
device_id: c42cc5888a0c7349d8425023efdedac7
entity_id: 28b1c57400b2c8bc5930b8889505edcb
```

seem to be unstable when devices are re-discovered. Use `entity_id` like `light.kitchen` in your automations etc.
